We then use network modelling and statistical null-hypothesis testing to show the presence of non-random deterministic patterns at different scales, between sites and within individuals. and used to confirm that individual macaques mostly shared viruses with other individuals from the same site, and only rarely with those located elsewhere By applying phylogenetic measures of β-diversity (Beta Nearest Taxon Index30, 31) to a subset of the community (applied to the 120 PbVs) we were also able to infer that these non-random patterns may be emerging due to dispersal limitation It strongly suggests deterministic mechanisms do exist to limit the co-occurrence of closely related viruses in the same animal, and while the specific mechanisms are unknown we postulate they could well include virus:virus interactions such as competitive exclusion (analogous to the theory of limiting similarity16) or virus:host interactions like immune recognition.},

  Abstract                 = {To migrate, animals rely on endogenous, genetically inherited programmes, or socially transmitted information about routes and behaviours, or a combination of the two. In long-lived animals with extended parental care, as in bats, migration tends to be socially transmitted rather than endogenous. For a young bat to learn migration via social transmission, they would need to follow an experienced individual, most likely one roosting nearby. Therefore, we predicted that bats travelling together originate from the same place. It is also likely that young bats would follow their mothers or other kin, so we predicted that bats travelling together are more closely related to each other than bats not travelling together. To test our predictions, we used microsatellite genotypes and stable isotope values of δ13C, δ15N and δ2H to analyse the relatedness and geographical origins of migrating hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus/Aeorestes cinereus (Baird et al. 2015 J. Mammal. 96, 1255{\textendash}1274 (doi:10.1093/jmammal/gyv135)); n = 133) and silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans; n = 87) killed at wind turbines over two consecutive autumn migrations. Contrary to our predictions, there was no evidence that related dyads of hoary bats or silver-haired bats were killed on the same night more frequently than expected by chance, or that the number of days between the fatalities of dyad members was influenced by relatedness or latitude of origin. Our data suggest that these bats do not socially transmit migration routes and behaviours among close kin.},

(1999) Present An Updated "Qualitative" Method For Identifying Species From Their Echolocation Calls. However, They Make The Assumption That, Like Bird Songs, Echolocation Calls Of Bats Are Species-Specific. There Is No Reason To Expect That Natural Selection Favored Incorporation Of This Information. Although Identification Of Some Species Of Bats By Their Calls Is Possible, Variation At Several Levels Makes Other Species Indistinguishable. Monitoring Echolocation In The Field And Identifying Species Can Be Useful In Determining Presence Or Absence Of Species And Factors Influencing Activity Of Bats. However, Limitations And Degree Of Reliability Of The Technique Must Be Recognized. Only By More Explicitly Defining How The Method Is Used And Quantifying Characteristics That Define Calls Of Recognizable Species Will The Method Be Scientifically Sound And Repeatable. I Suggest A Number Of Guidelines For Use Of The Method In Field Studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Competition for resources has long been viewed as a key agent of divergent selection. Theory holds that populations facing severe intraspecific competition will tend to use a wider range of resources, possibly even using entirely novel resources that are less in demand. Yet, there have been few experimental tests of these ideas. Using the bacterial virus (bacteriophage) ϕ6 as a model system, we examined whether competition for host resources promotes the evolution of novel resource use. In the laboratory, ϕ6 exhibits a narrow host range but readily produces mutants capable of infecting novel bacterial hosts. Here, we show that when ϕ6 populations were subjected to intense intraspecific competition for their standard laboratory host, they rapidly evolved new generalist morphs that infect novel hosts. Our results therefore suggest that competition for host resources may drive the evolution of host range expansion in viruses. More generally, our findings demonstrate that intraspecific resource competition can indeed promote the evolution of novel resource-use phenotypes.},

A given data set has only a finite amount of information; each time a parameter estimate is made, the information left is reduced. Increasing the number of parameters eventually makes the fitted model unstable and uninformative. A second serious drawback arises when, as is common, the global model has many parameters in it (dozens, sometimes hundreds).}

Since the extent of geographic sampling can strongly influence the measure of FST (Burland and Worthington Wilmer 2001), we used the residuals of a regression of FST against the maximum distance (log transformed) between sampling sites of each study},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we consider a competition system in which two diseases spread by contact. We characterize the system behavior, establishing that only some configurations are possible. In particular, we discover that coexistence of the two strains is not possible, under the assumptions of the model. A number of transcritical bifurcations relates the more relevant system's equilibria. Coexistence via persistent oscillations is shown. Bistability is shown between a situation in which only the disease-unaffected population thrives and another one containing only the second population with endemic disease. An accurate computation of the separating surface of the basins of attraction of these two mutually exclusive equilibria is obtained via novel results in approximation theory. The behavior of the ecosystem in some of the parameter spaces is investigated.},

  Abstract                 = {Pigeons Home Along Idiosyncratic Habitual Routes From Familiar Locations. It Has Been Suggested That Memorized Visual Landmarks Underpin This Route Learning. However, The Inability To Experimentally Alter The Landscape On Large Scales Has Hindered The Discovery Of The Particular Features To Which Birds Attend. Here, We Present A Method For Objectively Classifying The Most Informative Regions Of Animal Paths. We Apply This Method To Flight Trajectories From Homing Pigeons To Identify Probable Locations Of Salient Visual Landmarks. We Construct And Apply A Gaussian Process Model Of Flight Trajectory Generation For Pigeons Trained To Home From Specific Release Sites. The Model Shows Increasing Predictive Power As The Birds Become Familiar With The Sites, Mirroring The Animal's Learning Process. We Subsequently Find That The Most Informative Elements Of The Flight Trajectories Coincide With Landscape Features That Have Previously Been Suggested As Important Components Of The Homing Task.},

  Abstract                 = {Culturally transmitted traits are observed in a wide array of animal species, yet we understand little about the costs of the behavioural patterns that underlie culture, such as innovation and social learning. We propose that infectious diseases are a significant cost associated with cultural transmission. We investigated two hypotheses that may explain such a connection: that social learning and exploratory behaviours (specifically, innovation and extractive foraging) either compensate for existing infection or increase exposure to infectious agents. We used Bayesian comparative methods, controlling for sampling effort, body mass, group size, geographical range size, terrestriality, latitude and phylogenetic uncertainty. Across 127 primate species, we found a positive association between pathogen richness and rates of innovation, extractive foraging and social learning. This relationship was driven by two independent phenomena: socially contagious diseases were positively associated with rates of social learning, and environmentally transmitted diseases were positively associated with rates of exploration. Because higher pathogen burdens can contribute to morbidity and mortality, we propose that parasitism is a significant cost associated with the behavioural patterns that underpin culture, and that increased pathogen exposure is likely to have played an important role in the evolution of culture in both non-human primates and humans.},

An ongoing supply of susceptible individuals for new infections via movement among subpopulations or seasonal demographic changes ensures metapopulation-level persistence."}

  Abstract                 = {{The transmission of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria in a mixed population of Thais and migrant Burmese living along the Thai-Myanmar border is studied through a mathematical model. The population is separated into two groups: Thai and Burmese. Each population in turn is divided into susceptible, infected, recovered and in case of vivax infection, a dormant subclass. The model is then modified to allow for some of the Burmese (given as a fraction P) to be infectious when they enter into Thailand. The behaviour of the modified model is obtained using a standard dynamical analysis. A new basic reproduction number is obtained. Numerical simulations of the modified model show that when P not equal 0 and the same set of parameter values used in the initial model are used, the Thai population will be in the epidemic state. In other words, the repeated introduction of infectious Burmese (no matter how small of a number) will result in a malaria epidemic among the Thais irregardless of the public health practice undertaken by the Thai government. In the presence of the infected Burmese, the Thai government would have to increase the facilitites to treat the people who are infected by the malaria.}},

  Abstract                 = {The seasonal movements of Eidolon helvum, Myonycteris torquata, and Nanonycteris veldkampi were studied over a 2-year period in West Africa. During the dry season, E. helvum roosts in at least one large colony (ca. 500 000 individuals) in the southern forest zone of Ivory Coast. Following the birth of young in February, males and females move into the savanna zones, and the progressive establishment and decline of colonies along a south--north axis indicates that E. helvum migrates at least to the Niger River basin by the middle of the wet season (July). During the dry season, both M. torquata and N. veldkampi are absent from savanna sites, but are common in the forest zone. With the onset of the rainy season in March, catch rates of both species increase first at a southern Guinea savanna site and subsequently at a savanna site 400 km to the north, indicating that both species migrate at least to the southern Sudanese savanna zone during the wet season. Both sexes of N. veldkampi migrate, but the migration of M. torquata is restricted to the immature male cohorts. I argue that the high amplitude of the seasonal fluctuations in fruit abundance at savanna sites creates a wet-season surplus of food which results in low intra- and inter-specific competition levels at these sites relative to the forest zone. This may provide the conditions leading to the observed annual migrations.},

The expected parameter estimates are unbiased (e.g. Fig. 1), and the statistical properties of the generalized linear model are well understood (e.g. McCullagh & Nelder 1989). If the main aim of the study in question were to analyse whether each of the predictors affected the distribution of birds, and whether the effects were con- sistent between years, this analysis should be entirely justifiable.}

The Information-Rich Property Of Such Composite Metrics Is Further Complemented By Machine Learning, Which Offers An Array Of Supervised Learning Models Capable Of Relating Canopy Characteristics To High-Dimensional Lidar Metrics Via Complex, Potentially Nonlinear Functional Relationships. Using Coincident Lidar And Field Data Over An Eastern Texas Forest In Usa, We Conducted A Case Study To Demonstrate The Ubiquitous Power Of The Lidar Composite Metrics In Predicting Multiple Forest Attributes And Also Illustrated The Use Of Two Kernel Machines, Namely, Support Vector Machine And Gaussian Processes (Gp). Results Show That The Two Machine Learning Models In Conjunction With The Lidar Composite Metrics Outperformed Traditional Approaches Such As The Maximum Likelihood Classifier And Linear Regression Models. For Example, The Five-Fold Cross Validation For Gp Regression Models (Vs. Linear/Log-Linear Models) Yielded A Root Mean Squared Error Of 1.06 (2.36) M For Lorey's Height, 0.95 (3.43) M For Dominant Height, 534 (8.51) M(2)/Ha For Basal Area, 21.4 (40.5) Mg/Ha For Aboveground Biomass, 654 (9.88) Mg/Ha For Belowground Biomass, 0.75 (2.76) M For Canopy Base Height, 2.2 (2.76) M For Canopy Ceiling Height, 0.015 (0.02) Kg/M(3) For Canopy Bulk Density, 0.068 (0.133) Kg/M(2) For Available Canopy Fuel, And 033 (0.39) M(2)/M(2) For Leaf Area Index. Moreover, Uncertainty Estimates From The Gp Regression Were More Indicative Of The True Errors In The Predicted Canopy Variables Than Those From Their Linear Counterparts. With The Ever-Increasing Accessibility Of Multisource Remote Sensing Data, We Envision A Concomitant Expansion In The Use Of Advanced Statistical Methods, Such As Machine Learning, To Explore The Potentially Complex Relationships Between Canopy Characteristics And Remotely-Sensed Predictors, Accompanied By A Desideratum For Improved Error Analysis.
