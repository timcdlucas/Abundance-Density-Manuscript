The interactions between population structure and density in pathogen diversity
================================================================================

Repo for manuscript and analysis.

This paper is a reworking of two of my [thesis](https://github.com/timcdlucas/PhDThesis) chapters.

It comprises simulations that test whether it is abundance, density, colony size, number of colonies or distribution area which most strongly affects pathogen richness.
These are directly taken from [Chapter 4](https://github.com/timcdlucas/PhDThesis/blob/master/Chapter4.Rtex).
Then I test the results in a comparative framework using data on colony size (from pantheria) and range size (from IUCN). 
This is a reworking of [Chapter 2](https://github.com/timcdlucas/PhDThesis/blob/master/Chapter2.Rtex) which used the same analysis and much of the same data but focussing on population structure.
