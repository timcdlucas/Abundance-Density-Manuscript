The interactions between population structure and density in pathogen diversity
================================================================================

Repo for manuscript and analysis.

This paper is a reworking of one of my [thesis](https://github.com/timcdlucas/PhDThesis) chapters.

For submission to Proceedings of the Royal Society: B

It comprises simulations that test whether it is abundance, density, colony size, number of colonies or distribution area which most strongly affects pathogen richness.
