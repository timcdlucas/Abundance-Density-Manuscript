A mechanistic model to compare the importance of interrelated population measures: population size, population density and colony size

Repo for manuscript and analysis.

This paper is a reworking of one of my [thesis](https://github.com/timcdlucas/PhDThesis) chapters.

For submission to Proceedings of the Royal Society: B

It comprises simulations that test whether it is abundance, density, colony size, number of colonies or distribution area which most strongly affects pathogen richness.
The simulations are run using my package [metapopEpi](https://github.com/timcdlucas/metapopEpi).






Abstract
---------

Zoonotic diseases are an increasingly important source of human infectious diseases, and reservoir host pathogen richness is a critical driver of spill-over risk. 
Host population-level traits such as population size and density, geographic range size and population structure have all been shown to be important determinants of host pathogen richness. 
However, empirically identifying the independent influences of these traits has proven difficult as many of these traits directly depend on each other. 
Here we develop a mechanistic, metapopulation, susceptible-infected-recovered model to identify the influences of independent population-level traits on the ability of a newly evolved pathogen to invade and persist in host populations in the presence of an endemic pathogen, using a case study of bats; a highly social mammalian order. 
We show that larger population and group sizes had a greater influence on the chances of pathogen invasion and persistence than increased population densities (and therefore decreased population structure) and number of groups. 
As anthropogenic change affects these traits to different extents, this increased understanding of how traits independently determine pathogen richness will aid in predicting future zoonotic spill-over risk.
