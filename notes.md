## Length restriction
As a rough guide, this means that to avoid these charges, articles submitted should be no more than 4000 words and not contain more than 2-4 figures



* TeX files submitted must be compatible with LaTeX2e. ScholarOne Manuscripts supports version 7.4.5 and earlier.
* **All files that are needed to compile the TeX source correctly must be uploaded with the submission.**
* When submitting papers in TeX, all figures (including vector and raster/image based figures, and figures created from TeX code) must also be supplied as PS or EPS files (PDF, JPEG, GIF or TIFs will not be converted).
* Type 3 fonts are not accepted. Vector fonts (such as Type1, truetype, opentype etc.) are preferred.
* Continuous line numbering should be included, for example, using the package lineno.
* A list of all sty/cls files accepted by Scholar One Manuscripts can be found here.
